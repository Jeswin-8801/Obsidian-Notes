> The `/opt` directory houses optional or third party software. Software that is not bundled with the operating system will often been installed in `/opt`. 

For example, the [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/) application is not part of the standard Linux operating system and gets installed in the `/opt/google/earth` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> - When compiling some programs from `source`, or otherwise installed in an unusual way, they often default to `/opt`
> - Unusual ways may include a program that has its own custom installer script or `extract the archive to /opt` and install.
