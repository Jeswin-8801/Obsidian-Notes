The files that get stored in `/tmp` include:
- Intermediate data required for applications and system utilities to run
- Local manipulations to temporary files, such as transferring or extracting ZIP archives

> [!NOTE]
> The `/tmp` directory is typically cleared when the server restarts, or when programs remove the temporary data they no longer need
