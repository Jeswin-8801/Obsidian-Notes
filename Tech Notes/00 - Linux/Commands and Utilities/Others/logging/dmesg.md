The <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">dmesg (diagnostic message)</mark> command is used to print or control the messages from the [[#Kernel Ring Buffer|kernel ring buffer]].

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6; color: black;">**Functionality**</mark>:
	It retrieves and displays messages related to the kernel’s activities, especially during the boot process and hardware interactions.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6; color: black;">**Usage**</mark>:
	Commonly used for ==diagnosing hardware issues==, ==driver problems==, and other kernel-related events.
    We can also filter messages, clear the buffer, or follow new messages as they appear.

### Kernel Ring Buffer

 The kernel ring buffer is a circular buffer in memory that ==stores log messages generated by the kernel==.
 
- **<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6; color: black;">Characteristics</mark>**:
	It has a fixed size, meaning that when it becomes full, the oldest messages are overwritten by new ones.
- **<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6; color: black;">Content</mark>**:
	Contains messages about hardware initialization, driver loading, and other kernel events. These messages are crucial for understanding the state and behavior of the system during and after boot.
