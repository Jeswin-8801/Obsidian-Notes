## Reaction Game

```python title:reaction_game.py
from random import choice, random
from string import ascii_lowercase
from time import perf_counter, sleep

print(
    "A letter will appear on screen after a random amount of time,\n"
    "when it appears, type the letter as fast as possible "
    "and then press enter\n"
)
print("Press enter when you are ready")
input()
print("Ok, get ready!")
sleep(random() * 5 + 2)
target_letter = choice(ascii_lowercase)
print(f"=====\n= {target_letter} =\n=====\n")

start = perf_counter()
while True:
    if input() == target_letter:
        break
    else:
        print("Nope! Try again.")
end = perf_counter()

print(f"You reacted in {(end - start) * 1000:.0f} milliseconds!\nGoodbye!")
```

## Hacking the Game using [[subprocess#`subprocess.pOpen()`|subprocess.pOpen()]]

```python title:reaction_game_hack.py
import subprocess

def get_char(process):
    character = process.stdout.read1(1)
    print(
        character.decode("utf-8"),
        end="",
        flush=True,  # Unbuffered print
    )
    return character.decode("utf-8")

def search_for_output(strings, process):
    buffer = ""
    while not any(string in buffer for string in strings):
        buffer = buffer + get_char(process)

with subprocess.Popen(
    [
        "python",
        "-u",  # Unbuffered stdout and stderr
        "reaction_game_v2.py",
    ],
    stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
) as process:
    process.stdin.write(b"\n")
    process.stdin.flush()
    search_for_output(["==\n= ", "==\r\n= "], process)
    target_char = get_char(process)
    stdout, stderr = process.communicate(
        input=f"{target_char}\n".encode("utf-8"), timeout=10
    )
    print(stdout.decode("utf-8"))
```
