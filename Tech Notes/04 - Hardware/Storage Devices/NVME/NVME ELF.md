The **ELF** (Executable and Linkable Format) binary that runs the firmware or software controlling the ASIC functions on an NVMe drive is stored in a **dedicated flash memory region** inside the NVMe SSD.

> This is typically a separate **firmware partition** or **reserved area** within the NAND flash chips.
    
> The firmware is loaded into the ASIC’s internal processor **on power-up** or reset.


> [!note] 
> - The firmware is **not stored or run from the host computer**—it’s embedded inside the SSD itself. 
> - In NVMe SSDs, firmware manages:
